## My First Practice Assignment

In the last two weeks I have been learning to work with **Python** and **R** programming languages using a variety of tools. 

This *repository* made with GitHub is a way to pracice these. I've written this README using *Markdown*, which is a *markup* language (slightly confusingly). 

| Programme | Language / Use | Features |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| RStudio | R | multiple windows, can write ad run scripts easily, more intuitive / easier to use than the basic R console | 
| Spyder | Python | simple and powerful, can run scripts individually. Easier to navigate files than with the Git Bash or Jupyter systems | 
| Git Bash | Python | clean, can see exactly what you're writing? More direct than reating a repository with GitHub etc etc - can navigate by writing commands in Python. Heavily used by git users | 
| Jupyter notebook | Python or R or Markdown | online, browser based, intuitively set up, can combine markdown scripts (so formulas, graphs, tables etc) very easily. Don't use for long, complicated or co-authored scripts. Maybe use to run and test code? | 

This GitHub repository will run and test some basic code features I'm learning. 

> I hope I get to grips with it. 
> > Eventually.
